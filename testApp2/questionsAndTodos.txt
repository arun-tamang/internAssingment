should i use delete method or post for logout as logout removes data from database?

how to propagate error message of wrong email, password, tokens, etc. without directly
giving res.send(message) on the spot?

Currently if a user logs in more than once multiple refresh tokens will be stored in the
database for the same user. So may be add user_id column to check or decode and get user_id
to check?

Do i need to check if refreshToken is expired and remove automatically from table or should i just verify the refresh token
and remove the token from table if date is expired?

should adding a user_todo item be a put or a post?

my implementation of tags is similar to keyword, but it should be opposite i.e. the more tags you specify the lesser the
no. of resulting tags should be.
